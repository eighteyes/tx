EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - GTM STRATEGIES FOR ZERO-NETWORK FOUNDERS
=============================================================
Research Date: October 29, 2025
Confidence Level: 85-90%

CRITICAL FINDING
----------------
92% of micro SaaS businesses fail within 18 months. The strategies documented represent patterns from the 8% that survive.

THREE CORE STRATEGIES BASED ON YOUR SITUATION
----------------------------------------------

1. HORIZONTAL B2B SAAS (30% of market)
   - Use: Product-led growth with viral mechanics
   - Reality: 2-5% freemium conversion (not 8-10%)
   - Requirements: 18+ month runway, eventual full-time
   - Success example: ClickUp ($278M revenue)

2. VERTICAL SAAS (70% of market)
   - Use: Industry expertise and layer cake expansion
   - Skip: Product Hunt, freemium, viral loops
   - Focus: Trade shows, associations, enterprise pricing
   - Success example: Toast (disrupted 30-year incumbents)

3. RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED (<5 hrs/week start)
   - Phase 1: Validation with APIs/no-code (0-3 months)
   - Phase 2: Traction at 10-20 hrs/week (3-12 months)
   - Phase 3: Scale requires 30-40 hrs/week (12+ months)
   - Reality: $10K+ MRR requires full-time commitment

SURVIVAL METRICS (Must achieve or pivot)
-----------------------------------------
- LTV:CAC Ratio: >3:1 (death zone <2:1)
- Monthly Churn: <5% (death zone >8%)
- CAC Payback: <12 months (death zone >18 months)
- Monthly Growth: >10% (death zone <5%)

TRUE COSTS (2025 Data)
-----------------------
- Organic B2B CAC: $500-$1,700
- Paid B2B CAC: $800-$4,664
- Content marketing: 6-10 hrs/week for 18-24 months
- Freemium infrastructure: Can consume 82% of resources

KEY INSIGHTS
------------
- Product-market fit FIRST, GTM second
- Horizontal ≠ Vertical (completely different playbooks)
- Part-time doesn't scale beyond $5K MRR
- 18-24 month runway minimum for organic strategies
- 2024-2025: Strategies work but execution harder

DECISION FRAMEWORK
------------------
Q: What type of product?
- Horizontal B2B (millions of users) → PLG + Freemium
- Vertical SaaS (5-50K companies) → Industry expertise
- Time-constrained → Phased approach

Q: How much runway?
- <12 months → Need revenue fast, skip organic
- 12-24 months → Mix organic + paid
- 24+ months → Can weather patience valley

WARNING SIGNS TO PIVOT
-----------------------
- Month 6: <40% users "very disappointed" without product
- Month 12: LTV:CAC <2:1
- Month 18: Not approaching profitability
- Any time: Churn >10% for 3 consecutive months

BOTTOM LINE
-----------
Success is possible but rare (8% survive). Requires exceptional execution, proper market fit, and realistic planning. Eventually demands full-time commitment for meaningful revenue. Choose strategy based on product type (horizontal vs vertical) and available resources.
