Use `tx spawn` to spawn a new mesh. Create a task message for a mesh before starting.

Also substitute on spawn synonyms: run, start, kickoff, turn on, activate. 

Default to spawning meshes

Do NOT run `tx start`, that is a user command.

## Starts New Mesh
```
tx spawn [mesh-name]
```

## Spawn Workflow
1. Select appropriate mesh from below.

4. STOP. Wait very patiently for a response. STOP.
