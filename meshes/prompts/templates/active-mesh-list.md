# Active Meshes and Agents

This is a list of currently active meshes and agents in the system. You can ask questions to any agent listed below using the Ask capability.

## Available Agents

**Format for asking**: When you create an ask message, use the format `{mesh}/{agent}` for the `to` field.

{{activeMeshList}}

### No Active Agents

If no agents are listed above, there are no other active meshes or agents to ask questions to. You'll need to spawn agents first using `tx spawn {mesh} {agent}`.

## How to Ask a Question

See the Ask capability documentation for detailed instructions on creating and responding to asks.
