✓ **5 Major Macro-Categories**: Vocal genres, Large ensemble, Chamber music, Keyboard, Dance forms
✓ **25+ Genre Variants** identified and classified
✓ **5 Evolution Matrices** showing genre family trees:
   - Opera Family (Intermedio → Baroque variants → Classical reform → Romantic)
   - Symphony Family (Sinfonia → Haydn mastery → Beethoven expansion)
   - Concerto Family (Grosso → Solo concerto → Specialties)
   - Chamber Music Family (Trio sonata → String quartet → Expansions)
   - Keyboard Music Family (Harpsichord → Fortepiano → Piano sonata)
✓ **Chronological organization**: Early Baroque → Middle Baroque → Late Baroque → Galant → Classical → Early Romantic
✓ **Reference quality**: Matches established musicological standards
✓ **8-10 derivative genres identified** for recursive research

### 3. **concept-guide.md** - Technical & Musical Concepts
✓ **18 Core Concepts** explained with pedagogical clarity
✓ **Sections A-H covering**:
   - A: Foundational harmonic concepts (Tonality, Figured bass, Cadence, Modulation)
   - B: Structural forms (Sonata form, Rondo, Minuet/Trio, Theme-and-variations)
   - C: Melodic/ornamental concepts (Ornamentation, Melodic style periods)
   - D: Textural concepts (Homophony vs. Polyphony, Orchestration evolution)
   - E: Harmonic concepts (Common-practice tonality, Voice leading)
   - F: Period characteristics (Style galant, Empfindsamkeit, Viennese Classicism)
   - G: Performance practice (Tempo, Dynamic markings, Notation evolution)
   - H: Pedagogical progression (15-step learning sequence)
✓ **Cross-reference table**: Links concepts to representative works
✓ **Foundation for understanding evolution**: Clear principles underlying all genres

### 4. **evolution-branches.md** - Genre Evolution Research Queue
✓ **10 Primary Branches** identified with chronological spans:
   1. Concerto Family Derivatives (1650-1820)
   2. Chamber Music Expansion (1750-1820)
   3. Keyboard Sonata Transformation (1700-1820)
   4. Operatic Variations (1750-1820)
   5. Symphonic Variants (1750-1820)
   6. Sacred Instrumental Music (1700-1820)
   7. Suite & Dance Form Consolidation (1700-1780)
   8. Specialty Instrumental Forms (1750-1820)
   9. Keyboard-Orchestral Hybrids (1760-1820)
   10. Song & Vocal Chamber Music (1750-1820)

✓ **Sub-branches for recursive exploration**: 30+ identified sub-genres
✓ **Research prioritization**: Tiered system (Essential → Important → Specialized)
✓ **Next research targets identified** for each branch
✓ **Enables systematic recursive genre spawning**

### 5. **playlist.txt** - Pedagogical Progression Playlist
✓ **35 Core Works** curated for learning progression
✓ **4-Phase structure**:
   - Phase 1: Baroque Foundations (Works 1-9) - 9 hours
   - Phase 2: Transition & Early Classical (Works 10-13) - 1 hour
   - Phase 3: Classical Maturity (Works 14-27) - 5.5 hours
   - Phase 4: Early Romantic Transition (Works 28-35) - 7 hours

✓ **~30 hours of recommended listening** (complete cycle)
✓ **Multiple learning pathways**: Chronological, form-focused, composer-focused, concept-linked, comparative
✓ **~25 supplementary works** for deeper topic exploration
✓ **Pedagogical guidance**: Recording notes, ensemble suggestions, listening strategies

## Research Quality Metrics

### Coverage
- ✓ Three major periods: Baroque (1600-1750), Classical (1750-1820), Romantic transition (1800-1820)
- ✓ Geographic regions: Italy, France, Germany/Austria, England
- ✓ All major genres documented with evolution pathways
- ✓ 15+ master composers studied

### Depth Analysis
- ✓ Genre evolution clearly traced (Baroque polyphony → Classical homophony → Romantic expansion)
- ✓ Form development documented (Opera → Symphony → String Quartet → Chamber variants)
- ✓ Technical principles explained (Sonata form, Fugue, Cadence, Modulation)
- ✓ Period characteristics distinguished (Style galant, Empfindsamkeit, Viennese Classicism)

### Pedagogical Effectiveness
