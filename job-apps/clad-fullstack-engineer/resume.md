## What Drives Me

**Craft:** I care deeply about UX polish, code quality, and system design. At AdMobilize, I built real-time dashboards where every interaction was considered; at GridMetrics, I refactored fragmented codebases into clean, modular architecture because it mattered.

**Ownership:** My career has been "talk to customer → define product → sketch UI → model data → write code → deploy → support." At Rokk3r, I delivered complete MVPs. At AdMobilize, I owned the full stack from IoT firmware through cloud processing to React dashboards.

**Business Thinking:** I've made decisions with P&L responsibility. At AdMobilize, I balanced speculative R&D against customer commitments and technical debt. I reduced feature delivery from 9 months to weeks by understanding what actually drove revenue versus what was technically interesting.

**Learning & Teaching:** I've mentored engineers from junior to senior, conducted code reviews focused on growth, and continuously evolved my technical toolkit. I share knowledge through documentation, pairing, and creating systems others can extend.

## Why Infrastructure Software

Infrastructure is foundational—boring until it breaks, critical when it works. Having built IoT platforms managing thousands of devices and real-time data systems processing terabytes daily, I understand that infrastructure software requires different thinking: reliability over features, operational excellence over rapid iteration, and deep attention to the unglamorous details that matter when systems run 24/7.

The generational infrastructure upgrade driven by AI, renewable energy, and bandwidth demands is a rare opportunity to build software that accelerates essential deployment rather than fighting legacy tooling designed for different constraints.
