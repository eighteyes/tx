# Cover Letter - Full Stack Software Engineer at Clad

Dear Clad Team,

I'm writing about the Full Stack Software Engineer position because Clad represents exactly the kind of opportunity I've been seeking: early-stage, product-focused, building critical infrastructure software where craft and ownership actually matter.

**On Craft:** I care about the details. At AdMobilize, I built real-time dashboards where every loading state, error message, and interaction was considered—not because someone mandated it, but because sloppy UX reflects sloppy thinking. I've refactored production codebases not because they were broken but because they could be better. When I write TypeScript (which I've used across Node backends and React frontends), I think about the next engineer reading it six months later. Code review comments I've written often focus on variable naming, component composition, and "does this abstraction clarify or obscure?"

**On Ownership:** My entire career has been full-cycle product development. At Rokk3r Labs, I shipped multiple MVPs concurrently by literally doing: customer interviews → product sketches → data modeling → React/Node implementation → deployment → user feedback loops. At AdMobilize, as Director of Product & Engineering, I owned everything from talking to enterprise customers about their needs to writing the Python data pipelines to designing the React dashboards they used. At GridMetrics, I worked directly with utility companies and emergency management to understand their workflows, then built the solutions. This matches what you're describing: "talk to the customer → define the product → sketch the UI → do the modeling → write the code."

**On Business Thinking:** I've made decisions with owner mentality because I've literally had P&L responsibility. At AdMobilize during our growth from 100 to 10,000+ devices, I balanced: customer commitments vs. technical debt, speculative R&D vs. revenue-driving features, engineering morale vs. delivery pressure. I reduced time-to-market from 9 months to 2-4 weeks not through heroics but by understanding what actually mattered commercially and cutting what didn't. When you're bootstrapped with 5 years of runway, every technical decision is a business decision.

**On Learning & Teaching:** I've mentored engineers from junior to staff level, conducted hundreds of code reviews focused on growth rather than gatekeeping, and built systems designed for others to extend. I learn continuously—my current side project uses OpenAI's latest models with RAG architectures specifically to stay current. I document not because it's required but because future-me (and future-teammates) will thank present-me.

**Why Infrastructure Software:** Having built IoT platforms managing thousands of devices and real-time data systems processing terabytes, I understand infrastructure software requires different thinking than consumer apps: reliability over features, operational excellence over rapid iteration, and obsessive attention to unglamorous details that matter when systems run 24/7. The infrastructure upgrades driven by AI data centers and renewable energy represent rare greenfield opportunities to build software that accelerates essential deployment rather than fighting inadequate legacy tooling.

**Why Clad, Why Now:** Four-person team in NYC, $2.7M raised from YC/BTV, building for underserved infrastructure construction market, full-stack TypeScript (React/Remix). This is the environment where individual contribution matters most, where product decisions aren't diluted through committee, and where shipping something excellent is possible because you're small enough to care about every detail.

I'm looking for a team where craft, ownership, business thinking, and continuous learning aren't aspirational values but daily reality. Based on your job description, Clad might be that team.

Happy to discuss specifics about technical architecture, product philosophy, or why I think construction infrastructure software is a compelling problem space.

Best regards,
Sean Canton
