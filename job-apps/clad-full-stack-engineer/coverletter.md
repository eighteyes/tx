# Cover Letter - Full Stack Software Engineer at Clad

Dear Clad Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express strong interest in the Full Stack Software Engineer position. Clad's focus on infrastructure software for constructionparticularly given the 7x growth driven by AI data centers, renewable energy, and bandwidth expansionresonates deeply with my career building systems that solve real-world infrastructure challenges at scale.

What excites me about this role is the combination of product ownership and technical execution. At AdMobilize, I spent six years as Director of Product & Engineering leading 24 engineers from prototype through $20M acquisition. I didn't just write codeI owned the business outcomes. When sales struggled with 9-month feature delivery cycles, I embedded myself in their pipeline meetings, worked directly with customers to understand requirements, and restructured our development process to ship validated features in 2-4 weeks. This wasn't just velocity improvement; it directly influenced contract closures and revenue growth.

My technical background aligns well with Clad's stack and needs. I'm proficient in TypeScript, React, and Node.js (my current AI interview platform uses this exact stack with Next.js), and I'm excited to learn Remix given my experience with React-based frameworks. More importantly, I bring the product-minded engineering approach Clad values: I've built features from customer discovery through deployment and post-launch validation, made business-aligned technical decisions considering P&L implications, and balanced rapid iteration with long-term system maintainability.

The "craft, ownership, business thinking, learning & teaching" framework you outlined perfectly describes how I work. At GridMetrics, I reduced deployment time by 90% through SDK developmentnot because it was technically interesting, but because faster deployment meant faster customer value and revenue. At Rokk3r Labs, I built a real estate analysis pipeline that went from 2-3 weeks to 30 seconds because that speed improvement was the difference between market viability and failure. I care about code quality and system design, but always in service of user experience and business objectives.

Clad's 4-person team at this growth inflection point is exactly the environment where I thrive. I've successfully navigated 0-1 product development (Rokk3r MVPs), scaling challenges (AdMobilize 100x device growth), and infrastructure modernization (Discogs marketplace decomposition). I'm comfortable with the ambiguity and ownership that comes with early-stage companies, and I bring both technical depth and business acumen to strategic conversations.

The construction infrastructure focus particularly resonates given my background in real-world systems: IoT sensor networks for grid monitoring (GridMetrics), edge device deployment for physical spaces (AdMobilize), and real estate data infrastructure (Rokk3r). I understand that infrastructure software isn't just about elegant codeit's about reliability, real-world constraints, and measurable business impact.

I'm ready to relocate to NYC and contribute immediately to Clad's growth trajectory, owning features end-to-end while influencing product strategy and team direction.

Looking forward to discussing how I can help Clad capitalize on the infrastructure software opportunity ahead.

Best regards,
Sean Canton
