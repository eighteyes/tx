# Cover Letter - Forward Deployed Engineer at HappyRobot

Dear HappyRobot Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Forward Deployed Engineer position at HappyRobot. With a decade of experience bridging technical implementation with customer impact—from building IoT/AI platforms at scale to serving as technical liaison between engineering and enterprise clients—I'm drawn to HappyRobot's mission of creating an AI-native operating system for the real economy.

The Forward Deployed Engineer role resonates deeply with my career trajectory. At AdMobilize, I reduced feature delivery time from 9 months to 2-4 weeks by working directly with customers and sales teams to translate requirements into technical reality. This wasn't just project management—I was hands-on building the IoT SDK, real-time data pipelines, and AI/ML workflows while simultaneously understanding customer needs and iterating based on their feedback. Most recently at GridMetrics, I worked directly with utilities, insurance companies, and emergency management clients, delivering custom integrations and analytics solutions from a platform processing 500M+ daily records.

My technical stack aligns well with HappyRobot's needs: strong TypeScript/React/Node.js expertise, hands-on Python experience, and production AI/ML implementation including my current project using OpenAI's LLMs with RAG architectures. I've managed third-party API integrations across dozens of systems, built full-stack applications from database design through UI/UX, and delivered MVPs under tight deadlines in fast-paced startup environments. At Rokk3r Labs, I concurrently designed and shipped multiple 0-1 products by collaborating directly with users and domain experts.

What differentiates me is the combination of deep technical capability with strong communication skills. My journalism degree and years of customer-facing work mean I'm comfortable explaining complex systems to non-technical stakeholders, conducting user research to inform product decisions, and managing expectations across Product, Engineering, and Customer Success. I thrive in the ambiguity of "work with the customer to figure out what they actually need, then build it"—which appears to be core to this role.

HappyRobot's focus on supply chain and industrial operations is particularly compelling given my background building systems for real-world constraints: IoT devices with intermittent connectivity, real-time data processing at scale, and enterprise integrations where "it works on my machine" isn't enough. The $62M Series B backed by a16z validates the market opportunity, and I'm excited about joining at this inflection point.

I'm based in the US and ready to contribute immediately to onboarding customers, building impactful features, and helping shape HappyRobot's product direction through direct market feedback.

Looking forward to discussing how I can maximize platform value for HappyRobot's customers.

Best regards,
Sean Canton
