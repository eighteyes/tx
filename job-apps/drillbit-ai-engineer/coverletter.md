# Cover Letter - AI Engineer at Drillbit

Dear Drillbit Hiring Team,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the AI Engineer position. With a decade of experience building production AI/ML systems from prototype to $20M acquisition, I'm particularly drawn to Drillbit's mission of making housing more affordable through intelligent automation—and the impressive validation that Mason already books jobs 3x faster than top human reps.

What excites me most about this role is the opportunity to build real-time AI systems with direct customer impact. At AdMobilize, I led 24 engineers building an IoT platform that scaled from 100 to 10,000+ devices, creating AI/ML workflows that processed real-time data from edge devices through distributed pipelines. More recently at GridMetrics, I architected systems processing 500M+ records daily from 330,000 IoT sensors, where I reduced deployment time by 90% and built Python SDKs that consolidated fragmented codebases—challenges that resonate strongly with scaling Mason's capabilities.

My background directly aligns with Drillbit's stack and needs. I've built production systems with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and OpenAI's LLMs, including my current project: an AI-powered interview platform using RAG architectures. I've designed real-time data systems using WebSockets and PubSub, experience that translates well to voice-based AI systems. At Rokk3r Labs, I delivered multiple 0-1 MVPs concurrently in fast-paced environments, demonstrating the velocity and innovation mindset Drillbit values.

Beyond technical execution, I've consistently served as the bridge between engineering and business impact. At AdMobilize, I reduced feature delivery time from 9 months to 2-4 weeks by connecting sales teams with engineering reality—a skill that would be valuable as Drillbit continues rapid growth from YC S24 toward broader market adoption.

I'm based in the US and excited about the opportunity to join Drillbit's Austin team in-person, collaborating with engineers from Apple, Microsoft, and SpaceX to make residential contracting more efficient and housing more accessible.

Looking forward to discussing how I can contribute to Mason's evolution and Drillbit's mission.

Best regards,
Sean Canton
